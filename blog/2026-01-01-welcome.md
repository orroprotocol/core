# Welcome to the ORRO Protocol Documentation

**Date:** January 1, 2026

**Status:** Beta Phase Pending (Rumoured to be early this year)

Welcome to the official technical documentation for the ORRO Protocol. This repository serves as the definitive guide for developers, artists, and community governors looking to build on the world's first "Design-Hardened" trust layer.

## What's Inside?

* **Reputation:** Deep dives into the MTC-001 philosophy and the OIP-1/2 technical standards.

* **Fragments:** Understanding how to package creative experiences into immutable on-chain artifacts.

* **API Reference:** Integration guides for Solana-native wallets and dApps.

* **Governance:** The rules of the "Gossip Box" and the roadmap for community-led administration.

## The 2026 Vision

As we launch into the Beta phase, our focus is on **Performance Resilience**. By implementing predictive compute budgets and the Signal Architecture (BETA-003), we are ensuring that trust moves at the speed of thought, even when the network is under pressure.

**"We move from machine pulse to human voice. We build trust in the void."**
