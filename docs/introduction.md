# Introduction to ORRO

ORRO is a decentralized trust protocol built on the Solana blockchain, designed to turn human reputation into a legible, sovereign, and actionable asset. By moving away from "black-box" social scores, ORRO introduces a transparent system where trust is earned through verifiable actions and creative provenance.

## The Problem

Traditional reputation systems are siloed, prone to "feature bloat," and often prioritize machine-driven metrics over human intentionality.

## The ORRO Solution

ORRO operates on the **Artifact Equilibrium**: the balance between a creator's self-sovereign identity (**MTC**) and the external validation provided by their peers (**YTC**).

**Core Design Principles:**

* **The Zero-Option Rule:** We maintain protocol integrity by keeping optional features to a minimum, ensuring that trust data remains clean and interoperable across any dApp or wallet.

* **Human-Legibility:** Every transaction and trust-point transfer is designed to be readable by a human, not just a machine.

* **Resilience by Design:** Through predictive ML compute modeling and a "Human-in-the-loop" Gossip Box, ORRO remains responsive and transparent even during network congestion.
