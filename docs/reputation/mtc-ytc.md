# MTC & YTC: The Dual-Code Standard

To make trust "Trustable," we split it into two sovereign codes:

1. **MTC (My Trust Code):** This is your **Internal Bucket**. It tracks your personal creative history, your fragments, and your "Resiliency Standard." This is where you document your path.

2. **YTC (Your Trust Code):** This is your **External Voice**. It represents the trust you extend to others. It is the "wink" you give to a peer when they fail better than anyone else.

**The Symmetry Principle:** In ORRO, you cannot receive high-level YTC (External Trust) unless your MTC (Internal History) shows a consistent trail of work. You have to put magic in your own bucket before you can influence the party.
