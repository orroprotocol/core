# The Trust Score: Live Reputation Logic

In the ORRO Protocol, the **Trust Score** is the quantifiable measurement of the "Magic in the Bucket." It is designed to reward **consistency, grit, and transparency** over mere popularity.

## 1. How to "Get Ahead" (The Calculation)

Your score isn't a gift; it's a dynamic calculation of two primary vectors: **MTC** (Your Internal Grit) and **YTC** (Your External Validation).

* **Proof of Effort (MTC):** Every time you generate a **Fragment**, you add weight to your score. The protocol rewards the _frequency_ and _depth_ of your work.

* **The "Fail Better" Multiplier:** Logging metadata in your fragments (Mood, Duration, Tools) increases the "trust density" of the artifact. A fragment with documented struggle carries more weight than an empty one.

* **Peer Resonance (YTC):** When other high-level creators endorse your work, your score receives a "Signal Boost." Because ORRO is an **Anti-Charade** platform, endorsements from accounts with long histories of documented work are worth significantly more than "empty" likes.

## 2. How to "Stay Ahead" (Resiliency & Decay)

The "Live" nature of ORRO means you cannot rest on past wins. To stay ahead, you must remain active in the creative party.

* **The Heartbeat Rule:** If a project ceases to produce fragments, its governance slows down. Staying ahead requires a consistent pulse of "magic" being added to the bucket.

* **Anti-Spam Throttling:** Rapid-firing empty fragments to "game" the score triggers a **State Sanitization** (The Void Principle), neutralizing low-value noise and protecting the integrity of the leaderboard.

## 3. The Performance Edge: Predictive Compute

In a live platform, trust must be updated instantly. To ensure your score stays "Live" even when the Solana network is congested:

* **ML Forecasting:** ORRO uses machine learning to predict network spikes.

* **Pre-emptive Boosting:** The system automatically adjusts **Priority Fees** so that your "Fail Better" moments are recorded on-chain without delay. You stay ahead of the network lag while others are stuck in the queue.
