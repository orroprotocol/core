# ORRO Fragments (V2.1)

Fragments are the building blocks of your project’s **Grit**. They represent individual moments of creative effort recorded to the ledger.

## Fragment Zero: The Genesis Fragment

* **Automatic Generation:** Every new Fragment Collection begins with the automatic creation of **Fragment Zero**.

* **Protocol Anchor:** This "Genesis Fragment" acts as the immutable starting point of the creative journey on the ledger and cannot be edited or recycled.

* **MTC Initialization:** Fragment Zero initializes the **My Trust Code (Grit)** for the collection, establishing the baseline for the "Human Lead".

## BETA Launch Strategy: "Daily Grind"

To drive platform traffic and pressure-test the consistency of the community, the following rules apply during the BETA phase:

* **Daily-Only Frequency:** The "Standard" minting option is locked to **Daily** intervals. Users must log in every 24 hours to commit their proof of work.

* **Grit Cap:** Fragment counts are capped at **0 – 999** per collection to ensure optimal performance during large-scale testing.

* **Traffic Driver:** Missed windows result in "Grit Gaps" that are permanently visible in the numbered grid, reinforcing the necessity of daily engagement.

## Updated Dashboard Metadata Logic

The vertical scroll dashboard now supports high-density analysis for users managing hundreds of fragments:

* **Sequential Numbering:** Grid squares are numbered **1 to 999**, allowing creators to track exactly where they are in their 1,000-day journey.

* **Live Status Indicators:**
  
  * **Square 0:** Always active (Genesis).
  
  * **Squares 1-999:** Toggle between "Committed" (Cyan), "Pending" (Grey), and "Expired" (Ash) based on daily commitment windows

## Creating Fragments

You can choose how to document your journey:

* **Manual Generation:** Create and upload fragments one by one as you work.

* **Automated Generation:** Set the system to automatically capture and log your progress based on your project parameters.

**Notes:**

* We are only using daily fragments for the BETA test (Alpha: Hourly, Weekly & Monthly).

* Fragments will be capped at 999 maximum total amount.

* Alpha will support Hourly, Weekly and Monthly minting of fragments.

* Unlimited cycles are limited only by the live-calculated protocol gas fees.

## Editing Fragments

In the current version, fragments are anchored to the time they were recorded. While you can edit the content of a fragment, you **cannot** move it forward or backward in time. The ±14-day time-shifting feature was exclusive to the Alpha version and is no longer supported to ensure the integrity of the "Human Lead".

## Recycling Fragments

If you no longer wish to keep a fragment, you can surrender it to the **Global Community Pile** (Alpha).

* **The Queue:** Users with **Trust Mode** active are automatically entered into a queue to claim recycled fragments.

* **The Draw:** If a fragment becomes available and it is your turn, you have **7 days** to claim it. If unclaimed, it returns to the pool for the next person.

* **Check Status:** You can view your current position by navigating to `Fragments > Recycled Fragments > Check Queue`.

## Experience Metadata (Optional)

You decide how much "Grit" to reveal. These optional fields allow you to add sensory depth to each fragment.
