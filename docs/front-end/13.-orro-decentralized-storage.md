# ORRO Decentralized Storage

## Arweave Storage

**Yes — a one-year daily fragment project with 2 MB cover art per fragment comes to 365 × 2 MB = 730 MB, and the permanent storage cost on Arweave in 2026 is roughly **\$12–\$18 USD** (≈ \$18–\$28 AUD) per user, depending on exact AR price and bundling discounts.**

That's very affordable and completely feasible for a real product offering.

### Quick Cost Breakdown (2026 Arweave Pricing)

* **Current Arweave cost** (mid-2026 average via Bundlr/Irys bundling): ~\$0.016–\$0.025 per MB one-time (permanent storage, no renewal).

* **For 730 MB**:
  
  * Low end: 730 × $0.0165 ≈ **\$12.05 USD**
  
  * High end: 730 × $0.025 ≈ **\$18.25 USD**
  
  * Realistic average: **\$14–\$16 USD** per user for the full year’s cover art (after typical 10–30% bundling discounts).

* **Why so low?** Arweave is a one-time payment model: pay once, stored for 200+ years. No monthly fees.Bundlr/Irys (the most common gateway) aggregates many uploads and passes savings — real-world costs for small-to-medium files are often closer to the lower end.

### Comparison Table for ORRO Users

| Scenario                       | Size       | Cost per User (USD) | Cost per User (AUD, ~1.55 rate) | Notes                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 365 daily fragments × 2 MB     | 730 MB     | \$12 – \$18         | \$18 – \$28                     | Full year, permanent |
| Typical user (lighter use)     | 250–400 MB | \$4 – \$10          | \$6 – \$15                      | Most real users      |
| Heavy user (5 MB avg cover)    | 1.825 GB   | \$30 – \$45         | \$46 – \$70                     | Still reasonable     |
| 100 GB max portfolio (extreme) | 100 GB     | \$1,600 – \$2,500   | \$2,500 – \$3,900               | Treasury-funded only |

### Why This Is Sustainable for ORRO

* **Beta / early alpha**: Subsidize from ORROT sales or ORROC fund — $12–$18 per user is trivial compared to the value of provenance.

* **Real usage**: Most users won’t hit 365 fragments in year 1. Average might be 50–150 fragments → **\$1–\$4 per user**.

* **Pinterest fallback** (as discussed): Offload full-res media to Pinterest → Arweave only stores tiny covers (1–10 MB total) → cost drops to **\$0.10–\$0.50 per user**.

* **Revenue offset**: Even a tiny ORROT usage fee (e.g., 0.1 ORROT per fragment save) covers storage many times over.
