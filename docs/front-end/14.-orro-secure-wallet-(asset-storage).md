# ORRO Secure Wallet (Asset Storage)

The ORRO Protocol provides a secure, integrated "hot wallet" for managing your digital assets. While this online storage is convenient for daily transactions, we strongly advise against keeping significant amounts of currency or irreplaceable fragments in the online assets folder indefinitely. To ensure maximum security for high-value holdings, users should regularly transfer assets to a cold wallet or offline storage solution.

## Wallet Features

The ORRO Secure Wallet provides the following core functionalities:

* **View Assets:** Monitor your collection of fragments, certificates, and tokens in real-time.

* **Transfer Assets:** Seamlessly move fragments and other creative assets between accounts or to external storage.

* **Receive Currency:** Accept payments and rewards directly into your integrated wallet.

* **Send Currency:** Disburse tokens for service fees or peer-to-peer transactions.

* **Gift Currency:** Reward fellow creators or supporters by sending tokens as a gift.

## Supported Currencies

The wallet is designed for multi-currency compatibility, supporting:

* **USD** (Fiat reference)

* **USDT** (Tether)

* **USDC** (USD Coin)

* **SOL** (Solana)

## Encrypted Keys

Your encrypted keys are the ultimate access point to your assets. **Never disclose these codes to anyone** unless you have absolute trust in them, as they grant full control over your wallet:

* **My Wallet Address Code:** `d1b5ced3552d2a716785843289acfdc6Uig8hfkEhTf47fTa171f1425b85a1f6c571345f80df3Kg9uf7aPJoU1`

* **My Privacy Code:** `CXPeim1wQMkcTvEHx9QdhgKREYYJD8bnaCCqPRwJ1to19H6tua7jkLhdm3w8BvgpTn5LZNU7g4ZynDmCiNN3q6Rp`
