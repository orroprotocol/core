# ORRO ICO & Share Offer

## 1. Master Tokenomics (\$ORRO)

The ORRO Protocol operates on a fixed-supply, deflationary model designed to ensure long-term scarcity and value accrual within the creative ecosystem.

* **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 \$ORRO.

* **Anti-Whale Provisions:** Individual participation is capped at **100,000 \$ORRO** to prevent market concentration, promote a decentralized holder base, and ensure a "Fair Launch" distribution.

* **Minimum Entry:** **1,000 \$ORRO** (\$10.00 USD equivalent during Alpha Phase 2).

### 1.1 Token Allocation Strategy

| **Category**             | **Allocation** | **Strategic Purpose**                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Investors (ICO)**      | **35%**        | Primary capitalization for Alpha Phases 1 & 2 development.                                  |
| **Community Trust**      | **20%**        | **The War Chest:** Allocated for grants, hackathons, and long-term protocol insurance.      |
| **Founders & Devs**      | **20%**        | Dedicated to long-term team incentives with a structured vesting schedule.                  |
| **Airdrop**              | **10%**        | Retroactive rewards for Alpha Phase participants, weighted by the **Grit Score** (OIP-001). |
| **Community Incentives** | **10%**        | Continuous rewards for high-utility contributions (Fragments, Mints, and Governance).       |
| **Liquidity**            | **5%**         | Seed liquidity for decentralized exchange (DEX) pools (e.g., Raydium).                      |

## 2. Supply Adjustment & The Burn Commitment

To protect the integrity of the early economy, the protocol employs a "Hard Landing" burn mechanism:

* **Investor Burn (35% Allocation):** Following the conclusion of Alpha Phase 2, all tokens remaining in the Investor Allocation that were not sold during the public rounds will be **permanently removed from circulation (Burned)**.

* **Airdrop Burn (10% Allocation):** Any airdrop tokens remaining unclaimed at the moment of the **BETA Phase transition** will be sent to a null address, hardening the circulating supply for long-term holders.

## 3. Asset Transferability & Liquidity

While ORRO is initially focused on ecosystem utility rather than centralized exchange listings, the protocol supports organic, peer-to-peer (P2P) movement.

* **Verified Transferability:** $ORRO tokens are fully transferable between verified ecosystem participants. Transfers may be facilitated via private registries or secure digital certificates.

* **Community Liquidity Hub:** A bilateral marketplace will be established within the **ORRO Community Threads**, allowing members to negotiate and execute direct P2P trades in a transparent, community-moderated environment.

* **DEX & Synthetic Integration:** The protocol may facilitate the creation of **Automated Market Makers (AMM)** on decentralized exchanges (e.g., Solana/Raydium). This includes the potential for "wrapped" equity certificates to provide 24/7 liquidity without the immediate need for a centralized listing.

## 4. The ORRO Community Fund (ORROC)

A dedicated 20% of the total ecosystem value is held in the **Community Trust** to serve as the protocol’s sovereign backbone:

* **Core Infrastructure:** Funding for server maintenance, storage (Arweave), and high-frequency ledger integrity.

* **Expert Engineering:** A standing reserve for senior developer engagement and critical protocol upgrades.

* **Protocol Risk Mitigation:** A general contingency fund designed to offset network congestion or emergency operational costs.

## 5. Team Vesting & Long-Term Alignment

To ensure founder and developer commitment is aligned with the long-term success of the protocol, all team incentives are subject to an industry-standard **Vesting and Lock-up Schedule**:

* **12-Month Cliff:** No tokens are released for the first year. This acts as a trial period to ensure team stability through the Alpha Phases.

* **Initial Milestone Release:** On the 12-month anniversary, **25%** of the total allocation is unlocked.

* **Monthly Linear Vesting:** The remaining **75%** is released in equal monthly increments over the subsequent **36 months** (for a total 48-month duration), ensuring a steady, non-inflationary release of team equity.
