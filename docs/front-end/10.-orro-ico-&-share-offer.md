# ORRO ICO & Share Offer

## 1. Master Tokenomics (\$ORROT)

The ORRO Protocol utilizes a fixed-supply model to ensure long-term scarcity and value retention within the creative ecosystem.

* **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 \$ORROT.

* **Investor Caps:** Maximum entry is capped at 100,000 \$ORROT per person to prevent "Whale" dominance and ensure a "Fair Launch" feel.

* **Minimum Entry:** 1,000 \$ORROT (\$10.00 at Phase 2 pricing).

## 2. Pricing & Alpha Phases

The ICO is split into two 6-month Alpha phases to fund development and build early liquidity.

* **Alpha Phase 1 (Early-Bird):** \$0.005 USD per token. 450,000,000 \$ORROT available for public sale.

* **Alpha Phase 2 (Standard):** \$0.01 USD per token. 450,000,000 \$ORROT available for public sale.

* **Tether Ratio:** The protocol targets a 100:1 ratio (\$0.01 per token), meaning Phase 1 buyers enter at a 50% discount.

## 3. Investor Safety: The Buy-Back Shield

To protect early supporters during the transition from Alpha to BETA, ORRO provides a guaranteed exit floor.

* **Service Buy-Back:** Tokens spent on platform services (e.g., Trust Mode) are eligible for buy-back at fair market value plus a 2.5% "Goodwill" bonus.

* **ICO Protection Guarantee:** Following Phase 2, users can request a reimbursement for up to 50% of their total ICO purchase, provided the tokens remained in the original wallet and pass an audit.

## 4. Share Offer: Equity Transition

Following Alpha Phase 2, a strategic share offer will be issued to move the protocol toward its corporate backbone.

* **Volume & Price:** 250,000 shares will be issued at \$10.00 each.

* **Deflationary Mechanism:** 100% of the capital raised from share sales will be used to burn up to 25% of all \$ORROT in circulation.

* **Exclusivity:** This offer is a "one-way" choice. Participants must choose between the **Buy-Back Shield** (Offer 1) or the **Share Allocation** (Offer 2); choosing one excludes the participant from the other.

## 5. Share Transferability & Liquidity

While not intended for public centralized exchanges initially, shares are designed for organic, peer-to-peer movement.

* **Transferability:** Shares are fully transferable between verified participants via private registries or digital certificates.

* **Secondary Markets:** A dedicated "Community Liquidity Hub" will be established in the ORRO Community Threads for bilateral trades.

* **DEX Integration:** The protocol may facilitate "wrapped" share certificates on a DEX (e.g., Raydium) to allow for 24/7 automated market-making.

## 6. Community Fund (ORROC)

5% of all tokens sold (approx. 50,000,000 \$ORROT) is reserved for the Community Fund to protect the protocol’s infrastructure.

* **Infrastructure (25%):** Server costs and ledger maintenance.

* **Expert Engineering (25%):** Senior Developer standby fund for critical fixes.

* **Ecosystem Growth (25%):** Weekly "Grit" competitions and creator giveaways.

* **Risk Mitigation (25%):** General contingency fund.
