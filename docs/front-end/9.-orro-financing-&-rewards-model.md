ORRO Financing & Rewards Model
==============================

To make ORRO a reality, we use a three-tier system that supports the platform, rewards our creators, and protects our investors. We operate out of **Switzerland** to ensure we follow clear legal standards for global growth.

## 1. The Token Sale (ICO)

We are launching the **ORROT** token in two stages during the Alpha phase. This allows us to fund development while keeping the entry price low for early supporters.

* **Alpha Phase 1:** Tokens available at **\$0.005 USD**.

* **Alpha Phase 2:** Tokens available at **\$0.01 USD**.

## 2. The Token Buy-Back (Safety Net)

We want our users to feel confident. For every 10 tokens spent on services (like "Trust Mode"), ORRO will buy those tokens back at a fair market price plus a **2.5% bonus**. This keeps the economy healthy and shows we believe in our own currency.

## 3. The Three Tokens

We use three different "assets" to keep the system balanced:

| **Asset**                   | **Type**     | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                                                        | Ratio | Price                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **ORROCommunity (\$ORROC)** | **Reward**   | Earned by helping the community. If you keep these in your app wallet, you earn **2.5–5% interest.**                                                                               | 10:1  | \$0.10 USD (100 @ \$10.00 Min. Sell)       |
| **ORROTether (\$ORROT)**    | **Currency** | This is the main token you use for tasks. It aims for a stable **100:1 ratio** to the USD for your safety.                                                                         | 100:1 | \$0.01 USD (1,000 @ \$10.00 Min. Purchase) |
| **ORROStock (\$ORROS)**     | **Equity**   | These represent "shares" in the company which can be bought as a "long term" investment. Buying one share burns 1,000 \$ORROT tokens, making the currency rarer and more valuable. | 1:10  | \$10.00 USD  = 1 Share (Min. Purchase)     |

## 4. Token Buy Back Scheme: "You Trust Us, We Trust You"

Once Alpha Phases 1 and 2 are complete, we will launch a 3-month "Buy Back" program. This is our way of standing behind the protocol.

If you purchased tokens during the ICO, you can request a full reimbursement for up to **50% of your total purchase**. To qualify for this safety net:

* **Hold Firm:** Your tokens must remain in your original app wallet and not be sold or transferred.

* **Verification:** You must complete a standard identity check and a wallet audit to prove you are an original "Guide" and not a bot or a reseller.
