# ORRO Compliance & Age Gate

## Decentralization with Verified Badge & Compliance

Full decentralization is ideal, but your Verified Badge compromise (email/phone from alpha) is pragmatic and necessary for compliance—especially with under-16 bans. From my search (web tool), Australia enforced a nationwide social media ban for under-16s starting Dec 10, 2025 (platforms like Instagram/TikTok must block creation). UK has proposed it (Tories in 2025), but as of Jan 11, 2026, it's not law yet—expect similar soon.

For ORRO (with "social media like features" e.g., Gossip Box, profiles, messages), you must comply:

* **Age Gate**: Require email/phone for Verified Badge — use them for age verification (e.g., DOB check via Twilio SMS or SendGrid email).

* **Under-16 Ban**: Block sign-up if <16 (self-reported + flagging). In AUS, fines up to $50m for non-compliance; UK similar under Online Safety Act.

## Open Source Solution

**Open-Source Solution**: Use open-source libs for verification (Rust backend)

```rust
Rust
    use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
    use twilio_sdk::Twilio;  // Open-source SMS lib

    pub fn verify_badge(ctx: Context<Verify>, email: String, phone: String) -> Result<()> {
      // Send verification code via Twilio/SendGrid
      let code = generate_code();
      twilio_send_sms(phone, code)?;

      // Store pending verification in PDA
      let badge = &mut ctx.accounts.badge;
      badge.email = email;
      badge.phone = phone;
      badge.verified = false;  // Wait for code confirm
      Ok(())
    }
```

Decentralize via on-chain flag for "Verified" — email/phone off-chain (encrypted in DB).

**Compliant, user-friendly.**
