# ORRO Service Fees (V2.0)

This list shows the token costs for various actions within the ORRO ecosystem. These small fees help keep the platform running smoothly and ensure we can continue building the best tools for our creators.

We have removed all level restrictions for these tasks to allow everyone full access to the protocol's features. Please note that while these actions cost tokens, **only "Minting a Fragment" earns you a Trust Point** (following our **1:1 Golden Ratio** rule).
