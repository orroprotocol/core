# ORRO Eco-system Explained

This document provides a comprehensive map of the platform's user interface and feature organization. It acts as a structural guide, categorizing tools and settings into specific navigation panels:

## Interface Layout & Navigation

* **Right Hand Menu (Social & Community):** Focuses on engagement with sections for **Followers**, **Favorites**, **Winks**, **Communities** (posts), and **Rewards** (activities and giveaways).

* **Left Hand Menu (Creative & Legal):** Houses the core functional tools, including **Projects**, **Fragments**, **Portfolios**, **Certificates**, **Agreements**, and **Assets**.

* **Bottom Shortcut Panel:** Provides quick access to **Home**, **Search**, **Gossip**, **Notifications**, and **Messages**.

* **Creation Trigger:** A floating circled **"+"** icon located above the shortcut panel is the primary method for starting new projects.

## System & Security Settings

* **Profile Management:** Located under Settings, allowing users to manage their image, avatar, badge, bio, and social links.

* **Security & Privacy:** Includes the **My Trust Code**, audit functions, and a **Private Mode** toggle that allows users to turn off "trust mode" for increased privacy.

* **Analytics & Support:** Provides monthly analytics and a help section featuring tutorials, FAQs, and feedback channels.
