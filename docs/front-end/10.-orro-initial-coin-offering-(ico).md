# ORRO Initial Coin Offering (ICO)

## 1. The Master Tokenomics (1 Billion Supply)

* **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 ORROT.

* **The "Investor Spread":** * **Maximum Cap:** 100,000 ORROT per person (Limits you to a minimum of 10,000 unique holders if everyone maxes out).
  
  * **Minimum Entry:** 1,000 ORROT (\$10.00 at the Phase 2 price).

* **Why this works:** It creates a "Fair Launch" feel. It prevents big venture capital firms from buying up the supply and dumping it on the creative community later.

* **Alpha Phase 2 Price:** \$0.01 USD (Standard).

* **ORROC (Community) Ratio:** 10:1 to USD (\$0.10). 1 ORROC is always worth 10 ORROT.
