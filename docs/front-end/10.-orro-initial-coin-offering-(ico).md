## ORRO Initial Coin Offering (ICO) & Share Offer

## 1. The Master Tokenomics (1 Billion Supply)

* **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 ORROT.

* **The "Investor Spread":** * **Maximum Cap:** 100,000 ORROT per person (Limits you to a minimum of 10,000 unique holders if everyone maxes out).
  
  * **Minimum Entry:** 1,000 ORROT (\$10.00 at the Phase 2 price).

* **Why this works:** It creates a "Fair Launch" feel. It prevents big venture capital firms from buying up the supply and dumping it on the creative community later.

## 2. Pricing & Ratios

* **Alpha Phase 1 Price:** \$0.005 USD (Early-bird).

* **Alpha Phase 2 Price:** \$0.01 USD (Standard).

* **The 100:1 Tether Ratio:** \$0.01 per ORROT. (This means Phase 2 buyers are buying in at the "fair value," while Phase 1 buyers get a 50% discount for their early trust).

## 3. Alpha 1: Initial Mint

* **Total Initial Mint (Alpha 1):** 500,000,000 ORROT.

* **Community Fund Allocation (5% of all tokens sold):** 25,000,000 ORROT.

* **Category Breakdown (The $250,000 Fund):**
  
  * **Server/Maintenance:** 6,250,000 ORROT ($62,500)
  
  * **Senior Developers:** 6,250,000 ORROT ($62,500)
  
  * **Giveaways:** 6,250,000 ORROT ($62,500)
  
  * **Contingency:** 6,250,000 ORROT ($62,500)

## **4. Share Offer: Equity Conversion & Deflationary Pivot**

Following the conclusion of Alpha Phases 1 and 2, the protocol will initiate a strategic equity offering. This offer coincides with the activation of the **Investor Protection Buy-Back Scheme**. To ensure ecosystem stability, participants must choose a single path: either **Liquidity Exit** (Offer 1) or **Equity Transition** (Offer 2). Opting into one program explicitly excludes the participant from the other.

**Capital Allocation & Token Burn:** A total of **250,000 shares** will be issued at a fixed price of **\$10.00 USD** per share. In a move to harden the protocol’s economy, 100% of the capital raised from this share offer will be utilized to **burn up to 25% of the total $ORROT supply** currently in circulation, significantly increasing the scarcity of the utility tether.

**Strategic Options for Token Holders:**

* **Offer 1: The Buy-Back Shield (Liquidity Guarantee)** This serves as a price floor for risk-averse participants. The protocol guarantees a buy-back of **\$ORROT** at a floor price of **\$0.005** (should market price fall below this threshold) or a baseline of **\$0.01**, providing a secure exit for early supporters.

* **Offer 2: The Equity Transition (Growth Incentive)** Participants seeking long-term protocol ownership may subscribe to the **Share Allocation**.
  
  * **Volume:** 250,000 Shares
  
  * **Price:** \$10.00 per share
  
  * **Benefit:** Direct equity in the ORRO corporate backbone and participation in the \$ORROT deflationary event.

## 5. Share Transferability & Secondary Market Liquidity

While ORRO shares are not initially intended for public listing on centralized equity exchanges (CEX), the protocol is designed to support organic liquidity and peer-to-peer (P2P) movement.

* **Transferability Status:** All shares issued under the **Equity Transition** are fully transferable between verified participants. Shares are held in private registries and can be moved off-market via standard legal assignment or digital certificate transfer.

* **Secondary Market Access:** * **Community Liquidity Hub:** A dedicated "Buy & Sell" marketplace will be established within the **ORRO Community Threads**. This provides a transparent environment for members to negotiate bilateral trades directly.
  
  * **Decentralized Marketplaces (DEX):** The protocol may facilitate the creation of a **DEX liquidity pool** (e.g., on Solana/Raydium) specifically for "wrapped" share certificates. This would allow for 24/7 automated market-making (AMM) outside of traditional trading hours.

* **Listing Contingency:** Trading remains restricted to private and P2P environments unless the board approves a formal transition to a public exchange. Until such an event, liquidity is driven by community demand and the internal "Triple-Token Flywheel" mechanics.
