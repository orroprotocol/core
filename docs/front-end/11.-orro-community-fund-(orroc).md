# ORRO Community Fund (ORROC)

## 1. Purpose and Launch

At the start of **Alpha Phase 1**, the protocol will mint an initial supply of **500,000,000 ORROTether (\$ORROT)**. From this supply, 5% of all tokens sold during the ICO will be allocated to the **ORRO Community Fund**.

These tokens are automatically converted into **\$ORROC**. This fund serves as the protocol's operational engine, covering server infrastructure, security audits, and specialized technical support to ensure the system remains stable and reliable for all creators.

## 2. Technical Support Strategy

To protect the integrity of the "Human Lead" ledger, we will maintain at least one **Senior Developer** on standby to address any technical issues—ranging from minor glitches to major system faults—during the Alpha Phase.

* **Primary Source:** We will first engage with the **Solana developer community** to source this expertise.

* **Secondary Source:** We will expand our search to other high-performance blockchain communities as the protocol scales.

## 3. Token Ecosystem

| **Name**           | **Ticker**  | **Interest** | Swappable |

## 4. Fund Allocation

The Community Fund is divided into four strategic pillars to ensure long-term health:

* **Server Costs & Maintenance (25%):** Keeping the high-frequency Gossip Box and Fragment Ledger online.

* **Senior Developers Fund (25%):** Dedicated budget for expert technical oversight and emergency fixes.

* **Giveaways & Competitions (25%):** Incentivizing the "Guides" through weekly rewards for the best Fragment Collections.

* **Contingency (25%):** A reserve for unexpected technical challenges or network adjustments.

## 5. Initial Financing (ICO)

5% of all tokens sold during the ICO will go towards the community fund.
