### **The Creator's Pledge**

Before a user can earn **MTC (Grit)**, they must align their "Magic" with one of the protocol's core creative energies:

1. **Beauty:** I focus on aesthetics, harmony, and the visual soul of the work.

2. **Chaos:** I focus on raw emotion, breaking boundaries, and unpredictable energy.

3. **Abstract:** I focus on ideas, concepts, and the hidden meanings behind the work.

4. **Integral:** I focus on the build—technical precision, structure, and lasting quality.

5. **Undecided:** I am still finding my voice in the lead.

**The Signature Oath:**

> _"I hereby pledge to respect and follow all of ORRO's rules and principles. I understand that my reputation is my bond, and if I am discovered faking my 'Grit' or breaking these rules, I may be penalized with Trust Score (MTC/YTC) deductions."_
