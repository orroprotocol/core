# Fragments: Bottling the Magic

A **Fragment** is the atomic unit of the ORRO Protocol. It is a time-locked, tamper-proof record of a specific creative event. If the Trust Score is the "Signal," the Fragment is the **"Source."**

## 1. The Anatomy of a Fragment

Every fragment consists of three layers that turn a "Better Failure" into a verifiable lead:

* **The Artifact (The Soul):** A digital "hash" of your work (a sketch, a voice note, a line of code, or a mood board).

* **The Context (The Pulse):** Metadata that records the _human_ side of the work:
  
  * **Mood:** (e.g., _“Inspired,” “Frustrated,” “Exhausted”_)
  
  * **Duration:** The exact time spent in the "Magic" state.
  
  * **Tools:** The software or hardware used (e.g., _“Solana-CLI,” “Ableton,” “Oil on Canvas”_).

* **The Proof (The Shell):** A Solana-based timestamp that proves this work existed at a specific moment in time before it was ever shared.

## 2. The Genesis Certificate

The first fragment of any project is the **Genesis Certificate**. This is the "Birth Record" of a creative idea.

* **Why it matters:** It prevents the "Charade" of someone claiming they had an idea first.

* **The Lead:** It establishes the **Provenance Root**. Every subsequent fragment in that project leads back to this certificate, creating an unbroken chain of custody.

## 3. Time-Locking: The Sovereignty of Timing

ORRO allows you to "bottle" your magic now and reveal it later.

* **The Vault:** You can commit a Fragment to the blockchain in "Obscure Mode."

* **The Reveal:** When you are ready to "Get Ahead" in the party, you unlock the fragments. The protocol proves you did the work months ago, even if you stayed silent until today.
